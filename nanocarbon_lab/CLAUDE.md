# CLAUDE.md

This file gives instructions to Claude Code (or any assistant) working on this repository.

## Project scope
`nanocarbon_lab` is a modular Python framework to **generate, validate and export** nanocarbon structures (1D/2D/3D) for first-principles (Quantum ESPRESSO) and classical molecular dynamics (LAMMPS) simulations.

The framework must remain **scientifically valid**: physical bond lengths, correct coordination, no impossible geometries, reproducible dopant / defect placement.

## Capped/defected CNT topology (fullerene_mesh)

`builders/fullerene_mesh.py` is the engine behind `build_capped_cnt`. It
works on the honeycomb's **triangulated dual** (each ring = one mesh
vertex; vertex degree 5/6/7/8 = pentagon/hexagon/heptagon/octagon), so
every ring edit (`edge_flip` = Stone-Wales 5-7-7-5, `contract_edge` =
divacancy 5-8-5, the seed polyhedron's poles = 6-pentagon caps) is a
provably Euler-consistent combinatorial operation, never a geometric
heuristic. **Do not** try to detect or edit rings by re-deriving them
from atom distances/`networkx.cycle_basis` on a curved/periodic shell --
that path was tried during development and produced silently wrong ring
counts (see the module docstring). If you add a new defect type here, add
it as a mesh-level operation with an Euler-invariant unit test (see
`tests/test_capped_cnt.py::TestFullereneMeshPrimitives`), not as a
post-hoc geometric edit.

## Golden rules for contributors / assistants
1. **Python >= 3.10**, type hints on all public functions.
2. **Docstrings** are mandatory. Each public function must document inputs, outputs, and (when relevant) the physical assumption.
3. Every builder must return an `ase.Atoms` with correct `pbc` and `cell`.
4. Every structure exported to QE or LAMMPS **must pass `validation.run_basic_checks`** first.
5. Random operations (dopants, defects, disordered foams) **must accept a `seed`** for reproducibility.
6. **No hardcoded paths**. Use `pathlib.Path` and user-supplied output directories.
7. **No monolithic scripts**: keep modules small and composable.
8. New features ship with a matching pytest test in `tests/`.

## Geometry quality (not just topology)

Correct ring counts are necessary but **not sufficient**: a shell can have
a perfect Euler budget and still be geometrically absurd. `build_capped_cnt`
relaxes against a valence force field (bond + true angle + non-bonded
repulsion, L-BFGS, exact analytic gradients) and records measured
statistics in `atoms.info["geometry"]`.

Two failure modes are already fixed here; do not reintroduce them:
1. **No real angle term.** Bond springs alone (or a 1-3 *distance* proxy)
   let the sheet pyramidalise and fold — this produced 66-164 deg angles
   with perfect-looking bond lengths.
2. **Taking the dual before smoothing.** Barycentric subdivision gives
   unequal triangles; atoms must be placed from a mesh already projected
   and Laplacian-smoothed onto the capsule, or structures beyond ~1000
   atoms fold through themselves.

Any change to the builder or relaxer must keep
`tests/test_capped_cnt.py::TestBuildCappedCNT::test_geometry_is_realistic_sp2`
passing: bonds 1.30-1.55 Å, angles 100-135 deg, zero sub-2 Å non-bonded
contacts, across straight, bent and defected cases.

**Curvature is limited by a strain budget**, not by taste: outer-wall
strain is `r_tube * kappa`, and `builders/centerline.py` trims a path's
amplitude until it fits (default 8%; >15% warns). Sweeping uses arc-length
parameterisation and a **rotation-minimizing frame** — never a Frenet
frame, whose normal flips 180 deg at every inflection point and would
shear a meandering tube apart.

Tube **radius is quantised** by the lattice (`R = 5*freq*sqrt(3)*bond/2pi`),
exactly as a real (n,m) tube's diameter is fixed by its indices. It is an
output, not a free input; `target_radius` picks the nearest realisable freq.

## Scientific guardrails
- Carbon bond length: default 1.42 Å (sp2). Accept anything in `[1.20, 1.80]` Å as bonded; anything in `(0, 0.9]` Å is a hard error.
- Expected C coordination: **2 (edge)**, **3 (sp2 bulk)**. Coordination >= 5 or == 1 in the bulk is rejected by validation.
- Dopants replace carbon atoms: N, B (sp2 compatible, coord 3), S, P (larger, often require local relaxation). The module flags clustered dopants as warnings, not errors.
- 2D structures: vacuum along the non-periodic direction must be `>= 12 Å` by default.
- 1D structures (CNT): vacuum in the two transverse directions must be `>= 10 Å` beyond the tube radius.

## Quick test commands
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest nanocarbon_lab/tests -q
python -m nanocarbon_lab.cli.main cnt --n 6 --m 6 --length 10 --out out/cnt --format qe
python -m nanocarbon_lab.cli.main cnt-cap --rings 8 --freq 3 --defect stone_wales:1 --out out/cnt_cap/demo
# GUI (needs tkinter + matplotlib); headless GUI tests:
xvfb-run -a pytest nanocarbon_lab/tests/test_gui.py -q
```

## Where to add things
- New builder type → `builders/<name>.py` + export in `builders/__init__.py` + test in `tests/test_<name>.py`.
- New dopant chemistry → `dopants/<element>.py`, reuse `dopants.base.substitute_atoms`.
- New exporter → `exports/<backend>.py` implementing `write(atoms, outdir, **kwargs)`.

## What not to do
- Do **not** export structures that fail validation without explicit `force=True`.
- Do **not** introduce non-deterministic random state without a `seed` argument.
- Do **not** add dependencies outside the ones declared in `pyproject.toml` without justification.
