# CLAUDE.md

This file gives instructions to Claude Code (or any assistant) working on this repository.

## Project scope
`nanocarbon_lab` is a modular Python framework to **generate, validate and export** nanocarbon structures (1D/2D/3D) for first-principles (Quantum ESPRESSO) and classical molecular dynamics (LAMMPS) simulations.

The framework must remain **scientifically valid**: physical bond lengths, correct coordination, no impossible geometries, reproducible dopant / defect placement.

## Golden rules for contributors / assistants
1. **Python >= 3.10**, type hints on all public functions.
2. **Docstrings** are mandatory. Each public function must document inputs, outputs, and (when relevant) the physical assumption.
3. Every builder must return an `ase.Atoms` with correct `pbc` and `cell`.
4. Every structure exported to QE or LAMMPS **must pass `validation.run_basic_checks`** first.
5. Random operations (dopants, defects, disordered foams) **must accept a `seed`** for reproducibility.
6. **No hardcoded paths**. Use `pathlib.Path` and user-supplied output directories.
7. **No monolithic scripts**: keep modules small and composable.
8. New features ship with a matching pytest test in `tests/`.

## Scientific guardrails
- Carbon bond length: default 1.42 Å (sp2). Accept anything in `[1.20, 1.80]` Å as bonded; anything in `(0, 0.9]` Å is a hard error.
- Expected C coordination: **2 (edge)**, **3 (sp2 bulk)**. Coordination >= 5 or == 1 in the bulk is rejected by validation.
- Dopants replace carbon atoms: N, B (sp2 compatible, coord 3), S, P (larger, often require local relaxation). The module flags clustered dopants as warnings, not errors.
- 2D structures: vacuum along the non-periodic direction must be `>= 12 Å` by default.
- 1D structures (CNT): vacuum in the two transverse directions must be `>= 10 Å` beyond the tube radius.

## Quick test commands
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest nanocarbon_lab/tests -q
python -m nanocarbon_lab.cli.main cnt --n 6 --m 6 --length 10 --out out/cnt --format qe
```

## Where to add things
- New builder type → `builders/<name>.py` + export in `builders/__init__.py` + test in `tests/test_<name>.py`.
- New dopant chemistry → `dopants/<element>.py`, reuse `dopants.base.substitute_atoms`.
- New exporter → `exports/<backend>.py` implementing `write(atoms, outdir, **kwargs)`.

## What not to do
- Do **not** export structures that fail validation without explicit `force=True`.
- Do **not** introduce non-deterministic random state without a `seed` argument.
- Do **not** add dependencies outside the ones declared in `pyproject.toml` without justification.
